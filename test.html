    <p>Diagnosis: Moderate</p>
    <p>The highlighted areas in the image show regions where abnormalities were detected, contributing to the diagnosis. These abnormalities are characteristic of diabetic retinopathy, including changes in blood vessel appearance and the presence of spots or lesions. The model classified the severity as 'moderate' based on the extent and pattern of these features compared to typical cases it was trained on. If this is your result, it is advisable to consult an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and potential treatment options to manage the condition effectively.</p>
